# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In order to interpret user needs, it is important to look at the project from the end users point of view. The user stories let us ask the question of "what action do you want to take and what do you want to happen when that action takes place?". This allows us to see the end goal, and gives us insight into  how the user is using and thinking about the program. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by breaking them down into pieces and setting goals for each incremental  task. I hope to incorporate utilizing a product backlog and sprint planning/review. I believe these methods can be applied in many different scenarios. The overall concept of breaking a large task into smaller ones, prioritizing them, then interating through individual sprints to complete those tasks is an efficient process that can be utilized in many ways. 

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe a good team member is reliable, open-minded, humble, collaborative, and efficient. These are all traits I would want in a team member and are traits that contribute to a collaborative and productive culture.
